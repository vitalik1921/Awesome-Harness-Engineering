# 🏗️ Awesome Harness Engineering [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> **The most comprehensive, information-dense collection of resources for harness engineering** — the practice of shaping the environment around AI agents so they work reliably in real-world production systems.

Harness engineering sits at the intersection of **context engineering**, **evaluation**, **observability**, **orchestration**, **safe autonomy**, and **software architecture**. While an agent is the model plus its tools, the *harness* is everything else: the constraints, state management, verification loops, and runtime infrastructure that make agents dependable.

## 🧠 Context, Memory & Working State

### Context Engineering

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please prefer resources that are:

- **Primary sources** — original implementations, first-party articles, or seminal papers
- **Specific** — about how agents are constrained, evaluated, resumed, observed, or orchestrated
- **Practical** — useful to practitioners building real harnesses, not generic AI commentary
- **Current** — actively maintained or recently published (2024+)

If two links say the same thing, prefer the more primary, practical, and implementation-oriented one.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidelines and the preferred entry format.
